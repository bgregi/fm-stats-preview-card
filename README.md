## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge has contributed a lot to my CSS knowledge, especially using the Flexbox model. I also had to research about responsive layouts for mobile and desktop. I ended up using the "desktop first" approach, but, as I learned, it's much more efficient to use the "mobile first" approach.

As this is my first "real" challenge in coding (I have been only studying through online classes and doing the exercises along with the teachers), I think I've learned many valuable lessons that are going to be of great use in the next challenges.
